The food itself was all fantastic! We got full off our apps and charcuterie board, so I def want to return and give their entrees a full perusing!

The only reason I still went through with ordering my food is because this was the second place I tried to get food from this morning and due to conditions similar to this, I walked out of the first place after paying for drinks I already got. The person who took our order was very nice and she was wearing a mask. They make you wait outside of the building and take your order outside which I thought was very nice and responsible!!! But as they were taking our order, someone from the inside came out and no mask in sight at all. Not on her ear or around her neck, nowhere. I was very upset but proceeded with my order because at this point Im honestly just really hungry and tired. I personally think this is extremely irresponsible especially in a state that is known to be one of the worst states in covid-19 cases. I am disgusted at the disregard for customers, AND HUMAN LIVES. Please please please STOP this nonsense, wake up, listen to the CDC and just common sense!!! I worked in customer service all my life and I will not stand in silence for unexcusable attitude such as this! I would love to give a 5 star review because the food is amazing. The fact that as a vegan I have to give a 1 star to an amazing vegan restaurant for such a stupid reason hurts me more than you may think.

Finally the time came that we could enjoy it. The services was good as in the server was informative when it was needed and also didnt forget to mention the lunch specials!!! Its super great because you come for lunch on a budget of maybe 15$ and you should be good even for tip. I did include their menu in the photos do you have an idea before you come in or if youre ordering to pick up or for delivery in San Elizario area. The food was great to start the soups were super yummy I got egg drop soup and it was not over salty and it 😂 came with complimentary dough chips (I think thats what the chips are called) they were a plus. Another thing I would like to provide is that the sodas are canned I didnt ask about pricing but something to think about because you can take home to recycle too. The rice both fried and just steamed were great!!!! Taste was as it should be. I got sesame chicken It was definitely drenched in sauce Im not a big fan of a lot of dripping sauce but I know its great if you mix in with the rice you get. I also added some cashew and almonds. That was extra in $$ but definitely gave it some needed crunch. I didnt try the shrimp chop suey but my boyfriend did day it was really good. I recommend to stay for dine in its not to busy around 1-3 on Sundays so if you want to come for late lunch youll get a special and still 😉 good service for yourself practically.,Positive,did not answer,no,TX, San Elizario

Pros: Parking was easy, not sure of this was because of the pandemic. I was able to make my reservation online. The fact they had dine in was great as I am not fond of outside dining in summer heat. Had the tasty meatball as an appetizer, the sauce was exceptional and fresh. Had the Branzino, full fish, amazing. Lots of flavor, nice veggies that had simmered in the sauce, delicate. Superb. Prices of the drinks were surprisingly reasonable. The food was priced spot on, it was not cheap but you received excellent tasting items. The service was super friendly and professional. Only con is that since they are operating in pandemic mode, the place is setup for take out. Normally it looks like its a small, rustic trattoria.

I called and let them know and asked them to check the others. They told me i could stop I for a drink to replace mine whenever. Went in last night ( a day later) and noticed the dusters lemonades were there. I thought maybe i just got a bad one and started checking the dates. They ALL expired july 7 2018.

Dont let this stear you away though. Fresh large pieces of lightly crispy boneless breast meat in the form of strips or on a sandwich. You can choose the variation of heat. This place is legit on the spice radar. My husband LOVES spicy food and chose the medium and was happy with it. Coleslaw is not mayo base and light yet crunchy. Their Crimson sauce has a bit of a spice to it that compliments the meal. We also got the Mac n cheese which was delicious. The Joey-Eat-Fries are a pile of yummy. Basically a chicken sandwich with no bread sub with fries. Everything is made to order which is worth the 10/15 min wait for it.

The broasted chicken is really good, and the minestrone soup is amazing with fresh veggies and tasted so home made!

For example, the unique Veracruz red clam chowder is usually a bit spicy in a delectable way, and at my last visit it was spilling over with fresh, tender clams. Their New England clam chowder isnt unique, but its a delicious traditional chowder thats as good as any in town. Another unusual dish is the sanddabs, a succulent white fish that once was available only on Catalina. A few places in Los Angeles offer it, but no place else in Santa Barbara has it, and at Lure its as good as any Ive had on Catalina. The almond pesto cauliflower is another unusual dish, and its a winner. The imported Scottish salmon is amazing. Theres so much else on the large menu that I cant cover most of it, but I will say they have a number of delicious special salads, and the desserts are great. The service is usually (not always) pretty fast, generally attentive, and always friendly. The decor is upscale oceanside fish joint, but the vibe is casual, hip, and convivial. They have a full bar serving good drinks, and again, some of them are delicious, unique creations. Theres an oyster bar in case thats your thing.

Where to begin.... we ordered ribs, sausage, and brisket. The ribs were AMAZING, meaty, moist and Tender!! The sausage and brisket were extremely greasy. My husband cut the sausage in half and grease poured out of it. It had really good flavor, but too much grease to finish. The brisket was also greasy, but it could have been from the sausage, it was ok. I went in to get drinks and noticed a lady with some cheese. She wasnt wearing any gloves as she was trying to separate the cheese into single blocks. She was then holding the bigger block of cheese against her apron which was dirty separating into single blocks again. Someone had said for her to get a beer for a patron, she opens cooler, gets the said beer, and goes right back to separating the cheese, She NEVER washed her hands!!!

We couldnt change them, but we arrived only to find that there were a couple of tables readily available that could have been used for five, so they are a bit prohibitive in this respect. Know your numbers for sure when you make one. Server: Our gentleman was quite nice and very accommodating for all our peculiar questions and requests (yes: Im that guy), but his wine chops are a bit lacking. When he was describing a Napa Artistry meritage, he tried to say that Petit Verdot mellowed out the wine, whereas PV is almost never a mellowing grape in blends, but a grape that gave our selection a bit more tannic backbone. He was quite excellent in his description of the food, however, and he took good care of us for the evening. Food: The amuse bouche needs work, Stephan: it was a bit too understated, and the crystallized fruit was not very effective. The appetizer we ordered was the foie gras with pop rocks selection. While I loved the flavor and texture of both, there was too large a serving of the custard portion. About half would be great (Im not the typical American). The pork tenderloin we had was simply splendid, however, and the portion was quite perfect. Get the coffee and doughnuts dessert: it will rock your world! Wine: The list was varied and well-spaced, albeit a bit one-sided from what we saw (heavily American and lacking in Latin-American labels, considering Pyless rep for that cuisine). We had sparkling rose with the foie and Artistry with the main course. Both matched very well. Overall, I would recommend going to this restaurant if you have $200 or so for a great meal. The prices are as you would expect for the food, although I think there are still a couple of holes with regard to the service, the front desk, and the wine menu. One shouldnt expect Charlie Trotter or the French Room here, but its not a far cry from being one of the best in Dallas.",Positive,did not answer,no,TX, Dallas

They are attempting to take ordinary home cooking and elevate it to bigger heights. My deviled egg appetizer was great. Decadent craziness with truffle oil. But after that it all fell apart. The Little Gem Chop sounded flavorful but in reality this take on a chop salad is over dressed into oblivion. Blue Cheese, ranch, and balsamic combined in generous proportions until it tastes like youre eating a sauce and not a salad. I sent it back. The main course was Hake. The catch of the day. Its an incredibly bland fish. They cooked it well but it tastes like nothing. The herb crust had zero flavor. Then they chose to put that herb crust on a layer of yam puree with some sort of tomato sauce and a pile of artichoke hearts. None of these flavors actually worked together. The tomato and artichokes were overpowering forces that still didnt add to the hake having zero flavor. I didnt send it back but it was not good. Dessert was the chocolate cake. For as dark, decadent, and over sized as it was, the actual flavor was weak. The layers separating the cake itself was like pure fudge. Hard to stab your fork through and overly sugary. Ive had many a piece of chocolate cake in my life and this was low on the list. It needed more of the dark bitterness. Something to give it punch. Overall I feel like Dish thinks more is better. These foods can be great but focus on the simplicity of great flavors and less on the ideas of slamming things together in overwhelming amounts. A really good piece of fish is good on its own. Add to it. Dont cover it up. People actually like the flavor of the greens in their salad. Let that still exist. Etc...",Positive,did not answer,no,TX, Dallas

I am placing a 3 star Rating since I have gone around 3 times. This last time the Server (Same gentleman that was behind the Bar) seemed to be unattached and in a bad mood whenever we asked for something that we needed (Ie Ketchup and Paper Napkins), this made us feel unwelcomed. However there were another two servers that were wearing a different (Hawaiian sryle) shirt and they were doing a great Job.

If you like good food but have a few HOURS to kill, give this place a try. We visited PapaGallo Cucina today for the first time. Upon arrival, we were greeted and told we could sit at the booth that was available, the employee would just need to wipe it off, which she later did. There were a variety of menu items for breakfast time - even for our selective eaters, including myself. Kristen, our waitress, was very pleasant and did attempt to check on us throughout our meal. The chef was also friendly and even brought out two small cinnamon buns for our small children to enjoy while we waited. WOW! Did we ever have to wait for our meals, despite the restaurant not being super busy on a Saturday morning. We probably waited upwards of 50 minutes from the time our orders were place before our first dish was presented. For our party of four, each dish was presented a few minutes apart from each other. The first person was just about done with their meal by the time the last plate was brought out from the kitchen. Not once, did our waitress apologize for the extreme wait or for the plates being delivered sporadically during our breakfast. We were easily in the restaurant for two hours!

My daughter wanted to ride more but we had already spent 100.00.. or have a card for people that frequently come and pay a price like we do at shipwreck for a season pass. Just my 2 cents though.

Ive tried near 50 local businesses without much to write home about. Juan-A-Taco by far surpasses all other local spots Ive tried. When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the exquisite care they took with providing a unique and inviting atmosphere. I refrain from providing details only so you can enjoy the subtle choices made as I did my first time visiting. When you receive your order, you will immediately notice the same care and love that was shown through the decor resonating through the food presented to you. Nothing here is sloppy or rushed. The food is fresh and made with the care you would expect from a local business who takes pride in what they offer to their community. Im typically the type of reviewer who can always find something to improve upon but not here. Actually I take that back. The only thing I could possibly ask for is a selection of hot sauces to compliment their exquisite menu. But I have to admit this is very much just a personal preference. (Consider yourself on notice. Lol) Ive learned very quickly not to trust the food in this town, but this spot breaks down all barriers. Kudos to the owner and the staff who make an outstanding product and serve it with love.

It now is a little more sophisticated feeling and the food is more like a steak house but in my opinion it lacks imagination and Kurrents was definitely better. This restaurant is good but I give it 3 stars because there is not a good option, only average or very good and I cant say the food was very good. How much creativity does it really take to broil a prime steak and offer some basic sides with it? I had the butter poached lobster (sous vide) and it really was quite bland, it needed more sauce and overall was not a special dish at all, even though the waitress said it was one of their most popular items. My wife had a filet mignon and it was perfectly cooked and excellent but again, it lacked that something special that in my opinion, the previous restaurant had. The service was as good as before but overall we did not enjoy this restaurant as much. Why do places have to change something that is already working and is excellent? This hotel is trying to make itself over as a newer, fancier resort hotel but I hope they dont lose their charm in the process.

The service was unremarkable, but efficient. I loved all the ordering options with the food -- pickY eaters will enjoy that -- but the product itself wasnt that impressive. My bison burger on a multigrain roll was pretty dry (though I did douse it in several of their tasty sauces). The fries -- and especially the onion rings -- were decent. Id love to try a salad next time as I saw several of people eating those and they looked promising.

I bought a groupon for $30.00 and was told to bring my swim suit and a towel. We got there around 11:00 am. We checked in and was given a little wrist band with my locker number on it. We procede to our lockers where we had to put a shoes in these little cube lockers. Apparently it you use your key wrong your locker doesnt lock properly. I had to ask for help. So i got my uniform and my little towel, so happy i brought my own towel with me. It wasnt crowded at this point, we spent almost 2 hours downstairs in the hot tubs with varying degrees. At 1:00 we headed upstairs to the second floor with the salad bar and saunas. Here was a little busier, both men and females are together as well as for children. Children were in the most part quiet for me but my friend who was with me said they were loud. I guess i didnt notice it because im always around kids and too me they were quiet. then we headed for the pool, i had put on my swimming suit prior to coming upstairs so while the rest of them went to appointments with massages, i went upstairs to the pool. Pool wasnt as crowded as i thought it was going to be. Now mind you my version of crowded is different then my friends. Crowded to me is when you cant get into the pool or when your in the pool and cant really move around. So for me it was great. The only thing that was negative was the chairs. there wasnt any to sit in. Almost all chairs had items on them. no people. So i stayed upstairs till about 3:00. The pool was getting busier, and my friend was complaining about the noise and all the children.Lifeguard was blowing his whistle alot. I think when its crowded like that theyll should be two at this section so he doesnt have to keep blowing it, But i didnt think that a lifeguard should be on his phone texting when hes supposed to be watching people, maybe if he wasnt on his phone the other guard wouldnt have to blow so often. So we went to get out of our swimsuits, i didnt know there was a changing area near the bar/inside pool until my friend took me there. Here it is look for an empty cube and put your towel there. Idk so i had carried my stuff with me. Here we changed out of our suits into our uniforms. My pink shirt and blue shorts. My friend was telling me about how she checked in on facebook and got a free mask. so i had told her i checked in before i left my house this mourning does that count. she said she doesnt know so i sign into my account again and checked in and got my free mask. There was a long line of people coming in at this time and what i like about it was that they have people on the otherside where you can check out and answer/ask questions . we headed for the food salad bar. $20.52 dollars later plus the $2.75 for a bottle of coke. I was telling my group of people i was with how could you tell how much our food was if we cant read the card reader, it was written in chinese or japanese. I couldnt read it. but when i looked at it i thought i saw it say 12.00 so i wasnt really concerned about it. Everything was find but the grapes werent ripe enough for me to eat. Yes my stomach did get upset after eating, which when i eat too much it does happened. Its not because of their food. so after eating i went to lay down for a while, At about 4:30 i headed back downstairs, undressed and got back into the hot tubs. At this time there was a life guard on duty in the locker room.When we were here earlier there wasnt one.I guess when there is alot of people they have to have someone on duty there. overall i liked this place alot and for being a holiday weekend it wasnt bad. I look forward to coming back. Fyi: there was one thing i was concerned about was in the hot tubs near the lockers, if that was a camera in the ceiling between the wet and dry suanas. I was saying to my freind that i thought they werent allowed to have cameras here because of the nakedness and children in area.",Positive,did not answer,no,NY, Queens

We didn’t have reservations and arrived a little after they were opened for the day. They have an outdoor pavilion for outdoor dining but we opted for indoor seating. We were the only ones inside which was nice. The staff were very friendly and professional. The decor was good and the selection of flatware and cutlery added nice touches to the enjoyment of the food and experience. The menu is concise and you’ll find something to enjoy and be able to share. We ordered the nori chips, warm oysters and fried chicken. And we had two rounds of drinks. All were surprising and beyond satisfying. It was enough food for the both of us. Everything was beautifully presented. The warm oysters were our favorite. If you enjoy oysters on a half shelf offer raw bar foods then you will most likely enjoy this too. It’s similar in that instead of chilled oysters, they are warm and not fully cooked. It already comes dressed with an umami dressing that pairs well with the briny oysters and finishes off with a delicate apple taste that also cleanses the palate. The limited time cocktail “out of the woods” was absolute sublime mainly for the fact that it is a warm cocktail and served from a Japanese iron teapot and poured into a beautiful teacup with saucer.

One thing that annoyed me was the ramen. When I order ramen that cost over $10+, I expect a decent quality ramen. Places like these, they have the nerve to use instant ramen packs which cost no more then 50 cents per pack and cheaper in bulk. How do I know? I can see the box and brand of instant ramen they use. I also buy the same ones I have at home. They just add the ramen in boiling water, put the seasons that comes with it and add some slices of beef on top and charge customers more then 10 dollars. With the same price you can actually go to a real ramen place that serve real ramen with hand made noodles and great toppings with tasty brouth.

I learned during my first visit to Patisserie Chanson that they have an evening/night face that is even more exquisite and sexy, with tasting menu of nothing but high end, unique, creative desserts! The entrance is located right next to Patisserie Chanson, but the waiting area is actually the front part of the closed up Patisserie Chanson. We got their 9:15pm reservation. We received a text from theme earlier in the day, asking us to make sure we arrive on time because they start right at 9:15pm. But, when we got there a few minutes before that, they were not ready to receive us. When they were finally ready, they came and took one or two couples at a time. Everyone was brought to their seat around 9:35pm. So, even thought the text said they start right on time, they really didnt... Anyways, the inside is quite small, with about 10 or so bar seating, and three sofas that can seat total of six. The seat at the bar counter is where the action is, you get to chat with the chef, and also you get to see all the dessert creations right before your eyes. When we sat down, we were giving a small ball of popcorn. It was Chili and Lime Sesame Popcorn, which is intended to make you crave some sweets. It was quite spicy! Then, we got what I thought was some kind of plants in a pot. But no, they were some veggies and cheese, disguised as plants! Another little appetizer before the real dessert tasting course. At the beginning, we were told a few rules. First, anything that is on the silver grate, they are not ready to be eaten yet. Dont eat until they tell you it is ready. Another thing is the use of flash photography. Another thing we were told is that the main chef, Chef Rory Macdonald was in Paris, and that another chef will be leading a show. Since we were not notified of this, we were quite dissapointed... Anyways, the show must go on... They will serve us Six-Course Dessert Tasting Menu for two full hours. There was an option to add Cocktail and Wine Paring to go with it. We decided to get the full experience, so we got the pairing as well. We had to taste Gin & Tonic Sphere, which is a cocktail on a plate. EVOO Eucalyptus, an olive oil gelato. Honey Rice Pudding with local honey. Ferrero Rocher, a hazelnut mousse. Miso Pink Grapefruit, miso pudding tart with gelato. Spiced Bosc Pear/Tonka with gelato. And then a little extra treat, alcoholic gummy bears. We had a good time here, everyone was super nice and polite, friendly and took care of all customers really well. But, the music was way too loud, it made it difficult to hear the explanations of the desserts and drinks. Also, we were told to ask questions and have conversations with the chefs, but they were just busy making desserts and not very friendly... The desserts were good and it is fun to watch them make them in front of us. But at the end, none of them really stood out. I wanted to be wowed by their creations, but they didnt quite live up to my expectations. They were mainly some kind of gelato, small portion and not very exciting flavors. So, good but not unforgettable. The experience itself was really fun though, it sure is memorable. Their tasting menu do change seasonally, so you can get different kinds of desserts from here.",Positive,did not answer,no,NY, New York

The space is nice, the food okay, the service in need of improvement, and the prices very unbalanced. Please see below for my review breakdown. Food: 3 Star - Portions are extremely small for the price on certain dishes, while okay on others. Ex. 3 piece of shrimp cocktail for the appetizer will run you a whopping $15, while an good sized steak dinner will run you $32. - Taste quality varies by dish. Steak was very salty but a good size, fries tastes/looked like they came out of a cheap frozen isle bag, Alfredo was bland but otherwise good, etc Alcohol: 3 Star - Ordered Moscato (sweet/sparkling) and Merlot. Merlot glass was 1/2 full. Moscato was in a full flute glass. Both were as expected in taste, EXCEPT I ordered a second glass of the same Moscato and received a dry Moscato the waiter swore was the same kind.... Service: 2 Star - Waited 15 minutes for a menu, and another 10-15 for order to be taken and bread basket to arrive. - Waiters are more interested in chatting with one another and looking around at tables to clean/attend than at looking at the actual customers who want to flag them down for something. It felt almost silly how long I had to eye sever waiters to get ones attention. Environment: 5 Star - Lovely environment/space",Positive,did not answer,no,NY, Queens

The flavors were traditional where it needs to be, plus a fusion twist to give you that surprise. To me the most surprising item was the beef short ribs. Who wouldve thought a big slab for beef short ribs served with avocado and fingerling potatoes with a curry based sauce over it could be so good? Plus, the servings were huge! Give them a shot , itll be more worthwhile than the few hundred thai places that you get mixed up in the corona/jackson heights area!",Positive,did not answer,no,NY, Queens

I was expecting a little bit of pastrami in the middle of it but there was a lot of pastrami in it and it was evenly distributed through the whole k ish so you got pastrami in every bite. Definitely a place to go back to. Much better than alot of the other places around that sell pastrami. They have other things besides pastrami as well like brisket, corned beef and other meats.

This is was my partner and my 5th visit. Previously I had given them 5 stars, but have to change it to 1 (since zero isnt an option). Today, July 15, we went for a meal during their happy hour, Colleen our server took down the order, and the foods and drinks were great and on time. However we noticed a couple of things: - Other tables were asked if theyd like anything else, they were also given a 5 mins heads-up when the happy hour was coming to an end. We got no such ask or heads up. - She also seated a guest on a table for two, even though the second guest came after 10mins. During a previous visit I was asked to wait outside since my partner wasnt with me. Even though it wasnt busy. - Lastly, once our meal was done, Colleen on her own decided to give us our bill, not once asking if we wanted anything else. Clearly she was in a rush to get us out of there. While everyone else seem to be just doing fine. Unfortunate experience, as we really enjoy the food here.

I delivered food with Door Dash, I know how easy it can be to misplace an order. I didnt even care about what I spent, it was a matter of-Im hungry and so are 2 other people lol. So I returned, waited in the store, and wasnt noticed til after about 10 minutes at the food counter with a receipt and a bag-when I finally said Im sorry, but can you help me? do I get attention. Theyve never seen that happen before and had no idea I had a problem. I believe that, I go there all the time and everyone is so great, most of yall we know on first name basis (hell even nick names). Its why I pay more for my cigarettes, drinks, food, whatever. I genuinely enjoy the staff, and she really was so surprised about it.

Of course, food is always a personal preference. I was not a friend of the owner but after I tasted a slice of the Grandmas pie, I became one very quickly. Trust me, if his food wasnt good I wouldnt give the man the time of day! I figured it was time for me to say something out here, tell people what I think about this place. I come from an Italian family. Trust me...I know good Italian food when I find it. I grew up working in the local famous Italian family restaurants called Alteris. I cooked for Lou when I was a kid...that was a long time ago! Alteris was the best! Nicks Panini Parms and sliced Italian meat Paninis are made on freshly baked Italian style breads (baked in-house) and they are just plain amazing! No canned sauce here. Nick makes every pot from scratch! The pizza is old Italian style. The taste, texture and quality you get back in Italy and pizza joints you find in NY City! Light thin crust, crispy and the thick crust Sicilian pizza, doesnt sit in your stomach like a lump of lead. Its very rare you find this old country style and quality anywhere locally. Nick uses the best cheese...Grande! If you think that doesnt matter...youre severely mistaken! The flavor of the cheese is what makes the pie, after the crust! Try a Grandmas Pie. Youll eat the whole damn thing yourself. This place is my all time favorite in upstate NY! Thank god Nick is here in Ravena.",Positive,did not answer,no,NY, Ravena

They replaced it with lobster, but its in some mediocre ginger sauce and it little bits and pieces that arent easy to eat. I really hope they serve the crab legs again at some point because they are steamed and so much better. The sushi is a limited selection but usually very fresh, and they have the nigiri (fish over rice) sushi; I love the salmon and tuna sushi. As far as the rest of the food goes, its pretty run-of-the-mill but a broad selection of your typical American Chinese take-out sort of food as well as some other American staples like pizza and meat/mashed potatoes. The service is alright. I will probably go back a lot less unless I see more crab legs. EDIT: They have crab legs again, as of July 2011. Maybe it was a seasonal thing?

I especially loved the chicken Marsala! The reason I never went back was due to the poor service. Our waiter rushed us throughout the entire evening. He really ruined it for us. We ordered a bottle of wine and a couple of apps and were still trying to decide what to order as our main course. This really bothered the waiter who told us repeatedly I need the food order Im going to need the order when I get back Still no decision not that I was surprised due to his behavior throughout the evening. This left a bad taste in my mouth and although loved the food never returned. Until last week that is! I wanted Bolognese this place came up on yelp and of course I quickly dismissed it due to what previously occurred. My fiancé suggested we just give it another try. We went and pleased to say a far better experience. We didnt make a reservation but were able to get a table. This restaurant is definitely a hot spot for people 70 and over. Not that it bothers me but you wont find a young crowd here. To start service started off a bit shaky but luckily towards the end turned out to be fantastic. Great bread and eggplant capanota is served! Really great! We ordered a chopped Italian salad although not on the menu they made us what what we wanted. Italian chopped salad with assorted pieces of meats and cheeses soooo delicious!!! Spaghetti Bolognese- Yummmmm a must!!!! Fried calamari- so flavorful light and crispy! You dont even need the marinara sauce it tastes great without it! Cappuccino- piping hot but watered down. We enjoyed the Bolognese so much we came two days later! This time we had room for dessert and ordered tiramisu! Amazing!!!! Everything was delicious and service was great prices are reasonable too! Im glad I gave this place another chance! I look forward to being a loyal customer!,Positive,did not answer,no,NY, NY 11788

I went to Burgerology in Huntington and other “trendy” burger places. A burger here is either $10 or $13 and still better, than the $16-$18 burgers in Burgerology. The burger I always get here? The boss hog. Amazing. As far as giving more options, burgers are now available in 1/4 lb and 1/2 Lb.

Once we placed our order we were given a pager so that we could wait in the car for our order to be finished. They are hot n ready, and one of the pizzas we ordered was ready for us immediately, but we had to wait (with our pager) for about 5 minutes until our crazy bread (and second pizza) was ready (and oh was it worth the little wait). I would definitely recommend placing your order in person for the time being until the excitement dies down a bit and business slows down to a normal pace. All staff members we interacted with were so kind and courteous.

My friends call them pigeon wings because they are so small. Tasty, but not worth the price or effort. Stick with the boneless wings if you want wings from Big Cheese. They also have fantastic bread sticks. I believe they are hand made. They come with a choice of marinara or a white garlic butter sauce. Both are great.

I had tri tip with horseradish on top of garlic bread. I not only loved the idea of this combination, but it was cooked perfectly. The tri tip was cold and tender, and it was great combo. My wife had a mediterranean salad; it had feta, lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, and a special hummus sauce. Im not so into salads, but it was pretty good. The atmosphere was very homey but modern. It felt comfortable, and the decor had a good balance between rustic and soft colors. I dont know much about interior design, but it had a good feel to it. The exterior looks like part of a castle, with a bunch of random businesses around it (I think if they had several restaurants in there, this would be happening spot). The service was excellent: A friendly host, and waitress who went over and beyond what I thought she would do, it being a Friday and all. She was nice and friendly, and didnt have corporate name tags. This is one of my new favorite restaurants in Redding. Im impressed.

My wife and I were visiting the area with my daughter and Son-in-law and decided to visit this restaurant. The line was long but it was worth the wait. The staff was friendly especially during the rush of Memorial Day Weekend. The food was fantastic. My wife and I had the Grilled Rock Cod Sandwich. Mine was Blackened and had a nice balance of heat (not overly blackened with spice) plenty of Rock Cod in the sandwich with just the right amount of Spicy Mayo. Their rolls are really good and make a great pairing for their sandwiches. You have a choice of Potato Chips or Cole Slaw. I also had their Clam Chowder - a must if you like Clam Chowder.My daughter had the Wild Prawn Plate - which she said was really tasty and said the Cole Slaw was well balanced not to much mayo. My son-in-law had their Grilled Prawn Po’Boy. Seemed to be a local favorite from what I could tell. They have beer on tap and also in bottles and cans.

Be prepared to try to find parking though as there is not much of an abundance of it. The view of Bodega Bay are pretty great too. Be sure to bring a camera and jacket; it is Bodega Bay and it gets a bit breezy and chilly. I decided to have the fish and chips and I did not go wrong! Mmmm the batter also uses local Petaluma based Lagunitas Beer too. My partner had the fish tacos and he said they were good but not great. Not great because they were a bit too oily.

The pandemic and the cost of doing business in California has done them in. I have no words. This place was a regular culinary delight and I will surely miss it. My deepest condolences and sympathies to the owners of this wonderful eatery serving delicious habit forming cajun cusine. I will miss you beyond words! Thank you for consistent excellance and always making me want more. I wish you the very best moving forward and all those folks in Tennessee just dont know how lucky they are to have you establish in their community! Original review: Wow find this place and find food heaven. Unique and spectacular in every way from the succulent authentic menu items to the decor and music. New Orleans in Santa Rosa and Healdsburg. Everything on the menu is outstanding including the popular shrimp po-boy sandwich and the Gumbo, to die for delicious! Be careful, this place could be habit forming. My highest recommendation for a unique and delicious meal in downtown Santa Rosa. Nuff said. 🤠",Positive,did not answer,no,CA, CA 95404

Well weve located our haven in C Js BBQ & Fish. The service was fantastic, the 2 gentlemen who worked there were very pleasant & the food was out of this world. I ordered the 2-way & chose pork ribs & chicken with mild sauce which comes with 2 sides as well (we both ordered fries & BBQ baked beans) for $21. My wife ordered the small catfish nuggets which was $14. Now I know the prices may seem high to some (who dont usually frequent BBQ establishments) but its really not considering we both had enough left over for an entire 2nd meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in search of authentic high quality food. Next time we go we plan to try the peach cobbler & some cake.

Unfortunately thats different fast food restaurants. McDonalds started having these great sales during Christmas for Big Macs for like two bucks and you get a big old meal for six bucks and I kept that going for like 2 weeks and at the very beginning it was really good. But towards the second month I dont know if management or something but all sudden everything was coming out cold and see how it could be with some pastors they can be great one day and completely different than that so hopefully management will fix it back going its a great McDonalds as beautiful as they have great for you set inside for kids a great little playground. So its really fun for the kids and its brand new its got a big parking lot even has electrical plugins for electrical cars at this McDonalds. Probably the first ones on Monument so I was trying to find something good to say. I stopped eating fast food because I ate so much for 2 months and its a bikini like 15 lb first time that made me overweight Ive never been overweight and all sudden I had a belly. so you know its got the kids and all that its now its McDonalds its going to be good enough thats for sure and theyre still having some pretty good sales going on. That was a thing with me and McDonalds is ever out they got so expensive compared to the other ones but they have been having some really great sales lately so why I went there quite often the last couple of months but I couldnt believe the way that game so I was like no Im not doing that anymore but if you have kids you know of course go enjoy buy electric car and thats where youre going to go to Target,Positive,did not answer,no,CA, CA 94520

Nice clean place with friendly staff. Ordered the French Toast, Spanish omelet with side order of steak fries. Pros: delicious food, fast service, and OMG do they bring large portions or what. Expect to take some home and prices were reasonable,. Ok it was low for freaking 4 bread French toast. Thats like 8 thick half pieces of French toast for under $7. Full breakfast for 2 under $30.

Staff is friendly but grossly undertrained and the cooks are inconsistent. Twice weve been there for breakfast and the toast came long after we got the rest of the meal and the perfectly cooked eggs over easy and bacon got cold before the toast came the first time. I had to eat the grits or they would be inedible. They re-did the eggs (while the toast got cold) and the egg whites were raw. The second time the toast came after the rest of the meal again and the eggs over easy had raw egg whites again and the bacon undercooked but the Belgian waffle was good. They redid the eggs over easy and it came back like a fried egg. All three tables in our area were wobbly which indicates the staff doesnt care. How can you wipe down three tables and not know they are wobbly and not adjust the feet? The customers are diverse and really seem to enjoy their meals. I ordered eggs over easy to test the skills of the kitchen and it was a massive fail. I would go back to try something else as the customers seem to enjoy other items but only if we happened to be in the area or really wanted a Belgian waffle as we drove from Concord to go there.,Positive,did not answer,no,CA, CA 94564

Our group munched on the grilled cheese special of the day with goat gouda (um, yes!), gruyere and fromage blanc. I tried it with and without Pancetta and both were gooey with crisp bread and a sweet and spicy relish of some kind that really made the sandwich. My chai milk tea wasnt huge on the flavor, but the friendly service was a huge win. We ended our dairy feast with some chocolate panna cotta. Holy goodness was that little snack a good one!

While you wait, you can stare at the menu in the doorway and figure out what you want.

I would have liked it to be a little less dry, though. $13.75 Three Egg Omelette w/ andouille, chorizo, smoked chicken-apple sausage, smoked whiskey-fennel sausage, avocado, gruyere, bleu cheese: This enormous omelette was loaded with meaty sausage and melted gruyere. It could have been a little more fluffy. $16.95 Smoked Salmon, Caper, Tomato, Scallion and Natural Cream Cheese Scramble: The smoked salmon had a lot more flavor than the sausage omelette. However, the more I dug into this, the saltiness really built up. The portions were rather large. Both came with roasted potatoes.

Personally, I havent seen anything dangerous happening whenever were walking to Dotties, but we dont stick around long enough to see anything. Its usually easier for one person to get a seat here (most likely at the bar) and the wait gets longer for big groups, because tables that accommodate groups are few. We usually have two eggs scrambled, but we request to have ham and cheddar cheese mixed in, and it is perfect! Thats what makes my husband loves this place so much.

When I was finally called in, I got sat at the counter since I was a singleton, but I didnt mind because I had a nice view of the kitchen. Since Id also had plenty of time to peruse the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted: the black bean cakes plate with coffee. It came out sooner than I thought it would and it was tasty! They formed black beans into two patties and smothered it in pico de gallo, cheese, and sour cream. I got a side of avocado to put on top as well and it was a delightful southwestern treat. It was surprisingly quiet inside the restaurant; normally breakfast places seem to be a cacophony of plates and utensils clanging and people talking but it was really calm and mellow, which was great.

Stop by for a quick slice on your way to the hook or while walking down Pacific, or grab an entire pizza to bring home. Now with 2.5 locations, this review could readily apply to any one of them, whether in the original location(s) at the end of 41st, or the newer location in downtown Santa Cruz. Ive sampled a variety of their slices through the year, and they certainly do the classic pies really well. The standout element to their pizza for me is the crust. Its voluminous and fluffy, fantastic for soaking up leftover sauce, grease, or oil. The cheese and sauce feel high quality and strike the right balance between simple and tasty. If youre looking for a place to sit down, head to the East Side Eatery on 41st where youll find some more options (of which Ive never tried) on the menu, including everything from brunch to burgers. Certainly not a bad spot to head to with a group of people, particularly if youre looking to pair your pizza with a pitcher of brew.

Jontys is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant nor a sketchy hole-in-the-wall mom and pop shop. Surprisingly, its a great spot to grab tasty banh mi sandwiches and rice plates on a warm or scorching hot summer day sipping on Vietnamese iced tea!! John and his wife, who operate this little humble-looking eatery, serve banh mi sandwiches, rice plates and salads situated next to the Morgan Hill Caltrain stop. A great couple, with happy attitudes and strong teamwork, Ive been coming back to their place ordering my favorite items off of their short yet toothsome menu! Best things to order IMO: Anchovy steak banh mi **take note: order it with an egg! You can thank me later!** topped with a fried egg (cooked anyway you like) Pork belly banh mi! That pork belly seasoned and fried to perfection, along with a fried egg? Oh yeah baby! Im salivating over it! Lemongrass chicken banh mi? Light yet delicious, so its not too heavy for your tummy. Any choice of meat or tofu, fried egg with rice and a side salad....a good amount of food packed into a small container? Also a winner in my book! Spring rolls are filling and the fried egg rolls are just okay, but I wouldnt skip it. Just try it for once or order it if you are slightly hungry with not a big appetite. If you happen to live in the area, check it out! You dont want to miss it. If you are just waiting at Caltrain, order something to go! If you are driving up North or South, make this place as your go-to stop. Trust me. You would want to come back. Will I return? Well as a regular customer, the owners who know me by name, and always greet me with a smile and converse with me? I think that says it all. Yes!!!",Positive,did not answer,no,CA, Morgan Hill

Bocce ball is great because it is accessible to all skill levels and ages. Thats not to say that you will be great at it but everyone can pick it up in a very short amount of time. Campo di bocce is the go-to place, and frankly, Im not sure who or where or what the competition would be as the only other bocce ball place I am aware of without doing any research is the Campo di bocce in Fremont. But this being the original, they have got it down. from the time you arrive and waiting for your court time you can fill your experiments with a beer or wine. Be forewarned however, that they do not serve mixed drinks and that beer and wine are going to be your only options for an alcoholic experience. Once your court time has arrived your group will he gathered for a quick rundown and rules and when the game starts you can have drinks and food to accompany your activity which is one of the greatest experiences Campo di bocce offers with competition drinks and eats being a hard combination to beat. When I Court time was over we were seated at the tables for a dinner which was served buffet-style and included penne pasta with sausage, beef in a mushroom sauce with mushrooms, it seemed to be a light angel hair pasta, chicken, and a caesar salad. Bread and butter was also offered. All of the food was surprisingly good as I find that buffet food is hard to retain good flavor when made in large quantities. After everyone was done eating the staff was kind enough to give us to go boxes to take home any of the leftovers.whatever kind of night you are planning for a small or large group I am sure that Campo di bocce will take really good care of you and I highly recommend this establishment for the activity the food and the experience.",Positive,"Thank you for this excellent review, Dat!

Also note that it is on a one way street that is effectively an El Camino frontage road. We got there around 1:30p on a rainy Wednesday and there was no line. The building does have a parking garage but I didnt look to see if it is controlled or not. We were able to find parking on the street right out front without any trouble. I would probably rate them a 4+ - my palate for tea is not that discriminating so it might not be possible for a boba place to distinguish itself enough to get a 5 from me based on quality alone. But with the favorable prices, the very friendly staff, and our hope for the success of this independent local business, Ill give them the benefit of the extra partial star. Well be back.",Positive,Thanks Roy for your wonderful comment and business. Hope to see you soon!,si,CA, Burlingame

It takes a special type of taste bud to like everything that comes across your plate but there were a lot of things that I was able to enjoy while there was a lot of things I did not like and theres a lot of things my friend was able to enjoy and things that she did not like. All that being said it has a very strange set up youre not really ordering the food off of a menu and you dont really have just one single server serving your table the setup is people are walking around the restaurant constantly with a plate in their hand and they ask you what do you want and you simply say yes or no and they put a circle on a piece of paper depending on the price level of that item. That setup is very weird to me so I didnt really understand it and no one really explains these things.

So lets start out with that, the Truffle Mac & Cheese is fantastic, the rest of the dining experience however was abysmal. Here you order at the counter, yet they claim a full service dining experience. We ordered the Nacho Fries, Mac & Cheese, Mediterranean Dosadilla, Burger Dosadilla, and for me the carnivore a Chicago hot dog (yes real meat!) with double coleslaw (since we already had fries coming as part of the Nacho Fries), and an add on green salad. What arrived at our table was a mixed bag of items, the Nacho Fries were a good combo but lacked seasoning. The Truffle Mac & Cheese was amazing, but both Dosadillas were visibly burnt and inedible (we picked at the insides of the Mediterranean one as the contents were really what we were after). The hot dog was served on very dry bread (the dog itself was also strangely very dry) and appeared with no slaw to be found. When I asked our server for my sides of slaw the first response I got sorry we dont sell them separately, when I said how about the slaw that was supposed to appear with my order, I was immediately told they were out of slaw (like he didnt have to check with the kitchen first), sorry, with no additional offer of anything to make up for this loss (HUGE fail in my eyes). When we complained about or burnt Dosadillas the manager reluctantly refunded ONE of the two (granted we had picked away at the contents of one), but took about 20 minutes to bring back the $. He had the staff bring us a cupcake to make up for this. The 2nd star added for the Mac & Cheese.",Positive,did not answer,no,CA, San Francisco

What ticked me off at first was that I waited and waited for one of the waitstaff to ask me what I wanted to drink while I waited for my two friends, but it wasnt until I grabbed one that they asked. One of the servers was excellent and very attentive through the rest of the evening, so that eased my initial feelings. Dinner started with an amuse bouche - a fried rabbit ear that tasted just like chicharrone. Then came along a salad of crispy sweetbreads & warm beef tendon with chilli & mint; Ive never had sweetbreads and I admit it was pretty tasty! Next we had the terrina of lamb tongue & fries with lambs tongue lettuce. We asked our waiter where our fries were as we chewed on the thinly sliced meat, which tasted like the meat you have with Vietnamese pho. It turns out, the fries were actually the thinly sliced meat and were lamb testicles. Hmmm. Nuff said. The remainder of the meal included: fish maw with chickpeas & minutina (yummy!), pork tripe, beans & blood cooked in vescica (tasted just like my moms diniguan, a traditional filipino dish), and candied cockscomb with cherries (I loved the rice pudding the cockscomb came with, but couldnt bear the gelatinous texture).

Located where the Cannery used to be. Arcade and laser tag will be added next door where the art gallery used to be. Same as the Cannery, you go up to the counter to order and they give you a number. Service is good. Everyone was really nice. Went on a slow night and even talked to the owner for a bit. Both me and the hubby had burgers- I had the Western Coast and he had the Kali Classic. The burger itself was juicy and flavorful. They even toast the buns, so the burger didnt get soggy. Had their regular straw fries which were nice and crispy. We also had their specialty craft sodas. Both the Cherry Limeade and Strawberry Watermelon Mint were tasty, but I reccommend the Strawberry Watermelon Mint, as its a bit different and I feel like it may become their signature flavor. They will have alcohol in the future! They also have other dishes on the menu, like Salmon and Ribs, which I am super excited to try next time. Definitely check this place out now!

Ordering was quick and easy. They are cash only in person though can do credit cards online, thats counter-intuitive for the 21st century, and an inconvenience since most people tap or swipe or chip to pay for everything. The UberEats delivery guy picked it up and had it at my door very fast. Everything came in a repurposed cardboard box, packed neatly. The drink came in a compostable plastic cup, so I give them a star for creative packaging. The bad: Unpacking the order, I found the sorta warm broth was in one container, the cold dessert put into another container, basil and sprouts in a ziplock, both the noodles and meat crammed into a standard Chinese-take-out folding box, with condiments, chopsticks and spoon in another paper bag. Logic dictates this broth is going to practically burn my mouth off at the restaurant should at least be a little hot when it arrives on order. There was no bowl. Call me high-maintenance, but, I wanted a bowl to eat it out of. What if I was at a park somewhere with no kitchen nearby? Ive had other takeout Pho delivered that came in a large cup, broth and beef and noodles together. This would have worked better for me, or at least include an empty bowl. Had there been raw meat, the broth wouldnt have been hot enough to cook it. The noodles were generous, though only a few small pieces of meat, tripe, tendon -- Worth the $12.50? Not so sure. I hate to give a bad review or make assumptions, but this was unlike any Vietnamese Pho Ive ever had. It strangely resembled Cantonese-style cooking using off-the-shelf ingredients I could get at the grocery store. I dont want to pay for delivered food I can make better at home. The Thai Iced Tea was meh, had no evidence of being composed of separate ingredients slowly infused together, so assumed that this, too, was one of those instant concentrates. For $5.50 from a Vietnamese restaurant, you expect the real deal. I can get a packet for $7 and make 5 pitchers full (about 30 glasses) of the stuff. Just sayin. On to the dessert. The black sticky rice paste wasnt bad at all. Hard to mess that up, certainly. The coconut milk had a chemical sort of odd smell, was a thick cream and tasted much like artificial coconut flavoring used in some baking. Still, the rice paste (which is probably also packaged) was the best part. I like supporting local businesses during the pandemic. I was tired from a busy day of remote work, and didnt really have the energy to prepare dinner or do dishes, so I thought delivery would be a nice treat. Spending $40 for a Thai Ice Tea, a bowl of Pho, and some rice paste dessert, I didnt think it unusual to expect something yummy. I really really want to like this place, and surely their other stuff might be worth another look, but not the Pho, not tonight. Just an honest review, and only my opinion.",Positive,did not answer,no,CA, San Mateo

The guac was good, chunky with no tomatoes (except the ones on top), but an incredibly small portion for $12. We opted for chorizo on top of the street corn dip - Im glad we did, as the dip didnt have a ton of flavor without it, but also bummed we did, and is brought the whole dish to $16. This was for a small cast iron dish with the equivalent of creamed corn. I liked the subtle flavor from the cotija and the taro chips vs. tortilla chips it was served with. The short rib quesadilla was the star of the show - super tender short rib, smoky creamy mozzarella, caramelized onions, in a crispy tortilla shell. The sopes, by contrast, were the worst of the bunch. Pretty bland, especially the chicken.

The garlic mashed potatoes were watery not creamy, and barely tasted like garlic. The sweet potatoes were amazing. Ceasar salad was a disappointment.

I wasnt expecting to find much beside the few places in downtown Redwood City that I knew of. As I scrolled through the options, I was surprised to see a little Caribbean restaurant near by. My partner an I decided to check it out. We both love Caribbean food, but dont often find many good options. There was only one occupied table when we arrived, but we were a little early for lunch. When we stepped up to the counter to order, we were happy to see Cariblue had not one, but 2 different tofu options, Jerk Tofu and Curried Tofu. We ordered both. We grabbed a table and were shortly awarded with our steaming dished of island joy. Both came with coconut rice (and beans) and plantains. I started on the curry while my partner started with the jerk. The tofu was a little fried and sat atop a bed of nice vegetables. The tofu and veggies were covered in a rich curry sauce tasting of allspice and clove with just enough heat to warm you from the inside. Halfway through, we switched plates. The jerk tofu was similarly prepared on a similar bed of veggies, but the jerk seasoning changed the whole experience. The sauce is a little wetter than some, looking almost like a green salsa. Its a little tangy and not so spicy. I really liked it. The rice was quite good and the plantains were terrific. While we were still enjoying our meal, the owner/chef came by our table to see how we were doing. We thanked him for the vegetarian options and he told us he was planning to add some new ones. We asked about Ital Stew, which is a vegan staple at many Jamaican places, and he said he was considering it. I really love to see owners get out an talk with the customers to stay on top of what they are looking for... The restaurant was mostly full when we left, so they should be around for a while. They are only open for lunch and into the early evening (6pm). It seems they also do catering. We are looking forward to returning to Cariblue and seeing what new vegetarian and vegan creations they come up with.",Positive,did not answer,no,CA, Redwood City

I’ve been enjoying trying different types of cuisine lately, especially local and smaller businesses. I called the restaurant and placed a take out order which was an easy process. Enjoyed a one on one conversation with the owner who actually stepped in to help me when my bike was being taken from outside the store right in front of our eyes. Talk about putting the customer first! When I finally got to sit down to eat the food, everything was just phenomenal! The sauces were rich yet balanced and incredibly flavorful! Like others have mentioned, fall off the bone tender meat! I am a sucker for plantain and enjoyed the aroma of the red beans and rice… possibly detecting some coconut. 100% would recommend, hands down!",Positive,Thank you very much,si,CA, Redwood City

Spicy Beef Ramen (5/5) When it arrived, I thought I was in for some trouble. The redness of the soup made me think its gonna be ultra spicy. The first mouth I had, it was love at first mouth! The combination of the vegetable, the meat, the bouncy noodles, corn and spice that made this an amazing combo. Super super love it. Soy Sauce Beef Rice Bowl (4/5) Sizeable bowl, nicely spread out. Steamed vegetables on one side, beef chunk, beef slices, rice and the soy sauce on the beef. It was a delightful and tasty meal. Even so, the two above beat this dish by miles.

When we came around 9pm, we waited 15-20 minutes before we got seated. To save time, we decided on what to order while we were waiting (youre given the menu on a piece of paper, and you mark what you want to order). My friend and I ordered beef, lamb, fish cake, vermicelli noodes, enoki mushroom, some fried tofu skin thing, and cabbage in the spicy broth. Once the broth started boiling, we put in some of the food into the broth. Its really really really hot (even after you take it out and rest it in your plate for a while), so I dont know why people are given hot green tea instead of ice water to cool down our mouths when theyre on fire. When I asked for ice water, I didnt notice until I was almost done drinking it that there was a strand of a mans hair in my drink. Our plates were also not clean. Comments about the food: - Spicy broth isnt that spicy. - The lamb has more flavor, but I prefer the subtle flavor of the beef. - The fish cake is so plain and not that great. Dont get it. - I didnt like fried tofu skin, although my friend thought it was the best. It was probably because I dont like tofu. - The enoki mushroom complimented the meat well; I recommend it. - The vermicelli noodles broke into 2390243924034234 little pieces so my friend and I had to search for them. I got way too into my search that I accidentally dipped part of my finger into the boiling broth. Ouch. That happened before we asked for the ice water earlier, so despite the pain, I just had to suck it up... I should have gotten udon noodles... Service is great. My friend and I were actually the very last customers to leave the restaurant, but they didnt rush us at all. They would still come back occasionally to ask if we needed anything. Total came out to be ~$44 (not including tip). Probably wouldnt come back here, but its very popular and usually filled with families, so try it out?",Positive,did not answer,no,CA, CA 95014

After coming here twice with a group from work for lunch, my verdict is that we will not come back. Service both times were extremely slow. Servers have been nice and seem to work hard, so I suspect that they are under staffed. Everything took forever, even getting drinks and water too over 20 minutes, also we had not ordered food yet then either. We decided to have dessert, which in hindsight was a bad idea. It took another 20 minutes to bring out the two desserts we ordered. Manager gave us a couple of coupons for our wait, but they are most likely not going to be used.

My husband and I were passing by and decided to try out this place for some drinks and starters. The vibe inside was great, we took the bar initially since there were not spots available for the table but upon request, one of the server moved us to a table that just got empty. We sat down and ordered our drinks. Being an Irish Bar, the place was big on Guinness (We love you Guinness!!). A lot of their meals were made using Guinness (Hooray!) My husband got himself beer and I went for the red wine, their collection was small but was at a great price and amount. I went for the Sirah and for my second turn, helped myself with the Pino Noir. For starters we tried Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Wings, Garlic fries and Potato Skin and all of it was amazing! Since we were there and were really enjoying the vibe, we decided to get dinner from there as well. I got their chicken sandwich which came with a side of either soup, fries or coleslaw and my husband tried their Beef Pie. The sandwich was okay but my husband was a bit dissatisfied with his meal, the pie was not at all flaky and was definitely reheated and hence was very soggy and bad. To sum it up, I would go again any day for the drinks and starters but dinner will be a no no.
